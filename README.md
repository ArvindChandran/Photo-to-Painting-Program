# Photo-to-Painting-Program
Simple Python program that takes an image as input and outputs the image as if it had been created by brushstrokes.

To use this program, simply replace the "image.jpg" in this folder with whatever image you want to use and then run the code in paintrend.py. 

Keep in mind that the program has a runtime that depends on the number of pixels in "image.jpg" so medium to high resolution images (such as the sample iamge provided) may take a couple of minutes to produce an output.
